# DiscRSS

## Overview

DiscRSS is a web interface for managing RSS subscriptions and notifications through Discord.It aims to provide a completely free experience for personal users. Additionally, it aims toprovide a solid point of reference for anyone looking to implement similar functionality.

## Purpose

I am building DiscRSS with the goal to learn:

- Component-based frontend development (React)
- Intermediate concepts in frontend styling (Tailwind)
- The basics of Go
- How to structure and design a testable, maintainable API in Go (Dependency Injection, SOLID, Domain-oriented etc.)
- How to deploy and maintain a serverless application (AWS Lambda)
- NoSQL concepts / philosophy (DynamoDB)
- How to provision observability infrastructure and orchestrate logs/traces/spans in code (OTel, Jaeger, etc.)
